# odin-recipes

This project was created as part of "The Odin Project". It contains the main page and 3 pages for different recipes.

During the development of this project, the following skills were used:
- The use of HTML boilerplate, elements and tags, working with text
- The use of ordered and unordered lists
- The use of links to other pages of the project as well as to other websites
- The use of Github commit recommendations for more effective workflow and preservation
- The use of VS Code utilities for more comfortable and fast development

All images used in this project do not belong to me, but to their respective owners.
