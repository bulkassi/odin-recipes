        <li>
            Drizzle the sliced apples with lemon juice and mix well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Break eggs into a large bowl. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add sugar to the eggs. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix the egg-sugar mixture using a mixer on high speed for at least 8-10 minutes. The mass should become pale and increase several times in volume.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sift the flour into the mixture in portions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gently fold in the flour fform bottom to top with lifting motions using a spatula to ensure the batter remains airy nd does not deflate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Line the bottom of the removable springform pan (23-24 cm in diameter) with parchment paper. There is no need to grease the sides of the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the apple slices on the bottom of the pan, then pour the batter over them.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake the charlotte in a preheated oven set to 180 degrees Celsius for about 40 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Allow the charlotte to cool completely in the pan, then turn the cake upside-down onto a plate so that the apple slices face upwards.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the dish has cooled completely, sprinkle it with powdered sugar.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It's recommended not to pour all the sugar at once but gradually while beating.
        </li>
        <li>
            In biscuit recipes, the amount of sugar in tablespoons often corresponds to the number of eggs. That means for a biscuit made with four eggs, 4-5 tablespoons (and an equal amount of flour) would suffice. Keep in mind that sugar affects not only the sweetness but also the structure and density of the batter.
        </li>
        <li>
            The quality and speed of mixing may depend on the shape of the beaters, with paired main attachments being most effective.
        </li>
    </ul>
